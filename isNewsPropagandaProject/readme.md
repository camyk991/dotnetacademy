## News Propaganda Detection and Rating System

### Overview:

The News Propaganda Detection and Rating System is a web-based platform designed to analyze news articles from various sources and assess their likelihood of containing propaganda. The system employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify characteristics commonly associated with propaganda, such as biased language, demonization of opponents, simplification and generalization, and emotional language. Each article is then assigned a propaganda score on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating a high likelihood of propaganda content.

### Features:

- **Article Analysis**: The system analyzes news articles retrieved from selected sources for propaganda indicators using NLP algorithms.

- **Propaganda Rating**: Each article is rated based on the presence and intensity of propaganda characteristics, providing users with an indication of its credibility.

- **Moderator Review**: Articles with high propaganda scores are flagged for review by a moderator who can adjust the rating based on their judgment. The moderator utilizes an admin panel for this purpose.

- **User Interaction**: Users can view articles along with their propaganda scores and provide feedback through comments and rating (like/dislike). A captcha system is implemented to prevent bot interference.

- **Trustworthiness Table**: The system generates a trustworthiness table based on the average propaganda scores of articles from different news sources. Sources with lower average scores are ranked lower, indicating they are less trustworthy.
